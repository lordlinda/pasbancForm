//e.g body parser allows us to access data from the frontend  using req.body

//and some others like cors,morgan,dotenv etc
//some middlewares such as morgan that is only allowed to run while our app is in developement
//but in production  it doesnt run
//we do this depending on the node environment constatnt NODE_ENV

//next we serve static files from the  frontend which are in the build folder
//however this should only be served during deployment and not production

//we dont hard code the  port because on deployment because the port may change depending on the port assigned
